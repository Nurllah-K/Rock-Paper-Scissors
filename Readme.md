<h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

The aim of the game is to try to win by choosing one of the rock, paper and scissors items. For each selected item, a random item is assigned by the system. Then both assigned items are compared. (Rock wins against scissors / scissors wins against paper, etc.) At the end of the comparison, it is checked whether the player or the computer chooses the item on the winning side, and the result is printed on the screen. If the item chosen by both sides is the same, the game ends in a draw.
